    f""" \nIt was a {Adjective}, cold November day. I woke up to 
the {Adjective2}smell of {Noun} roasting in the {Noun2} downstairs. I 
quickly got dressed and ran down to the {Plural_Noun} to see if I could
help {Verb_ing} the dinner. My mom said, 'See if {Game} is ready to be
played.' So I {Verb_ing2} down to the {Plural_Noun2} room and found
{Verb_ing3} with my {Noun3}. After we played {Game}, I was exhausted. I
climbed into bed and pulled the {Plant} over my {Body_Part}. It wasn't
long before I was {Verb_ing4} asleep. \n\nThe End\n\nAs I slept, I dreamt
about {Adjective3} {Plural_Noun2} chasing me through {Place} and a giant
{Noun} with {Number} {Adjective} heads."""
